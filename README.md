# triangulation_game
Inspired by the New York Times Vertex game. This is a procedurally generated version.

Current controls:
Clicking near a point and dragging near another will drop an edge between them. Right click will undo. Left click away from any points and dragging will pan the view. Scroll wheel will zoom.

To change the puzzle change the seed in the main "game.py" file. This is at the bottom in the line "g = triangulation(SEED, verbose=False)"
